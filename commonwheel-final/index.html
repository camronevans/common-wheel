          Common Wheel has provided access to meaningful and engaging activities
          across local communities in Glasgow since our founding in 2001. We

            Glasgow has quickly transformed into a bike-friendly city, and we've
            followed suit with our Bike Project. With the help of the community
            and a team of of skilled engineers, we're able to repair and recycle
            bikes with a new purpose to be cherished

            Our Climbing Project is a little newer to us, first introduced in
            August 2019. We're fortunate enough to collaborate with The Climbing
            Academy, providing coaching for those just getting started and for
            climbers with more than just a few hours under their belt.

      <div>
        <p class="blue">
          Back in 1997 the basic concept of bicycle recycling as occupational
          therapy was developed by Colin Guthrie (GP), Alistair Wilson
          (Consultant Psychiatrist) and Neil McDonald (cycle enthusiast). In
          1999, with the support of Glasgow City Council, we secured our first
          bike workshop in Maryhill (North West Glasgow). On 14 June 2001 we
          were granted charitable status and registered as a limited company. We
          opened a second workshop in Bridgeton (North East Glasgow) in 2006.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="green">
          <p>
            The music arm of our project was set up by Julie De Simone and
            Alistair Wilson in 2004. The idea for the project was drawn from
            Julie's experiences in mental health care and as a music teacher:
            the idea being that music could be used to reach people, enable
            self-expression, and combat the boredom and isolation experienced by
            many in psychiatric care. Julie fundraised for the project herself,
            beginning by growing and selling pot plants to buy the first set of
            instruments. By securing larger grants Julie helped the project to
            develop. It now reaches over 100 people with mental illness and
            dementia each month.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016 our steering group proposed that it would be good to have a
            third activity. After a successful pilot, we rolled out our visual
            arts project, Carnival Club, in 2017. So far we have exhibited our
            creations at the Glasgow Style Mile Carnival and the Merchant City
            Festival. The project has received good feedback from the clients
            and also from the spectators.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018 one of our trustees, Judith Foster, suggested adding indoor
            climbing as a fourth activity. There is evidence that physical
            activity is beneficial for mental health as well as physical health,
            and that climbing is particularly effective. After extensive
            consultations our indoor climbing course was piloted in 2019.
            Feedback from the participants has been very positive and the
            project is continuing to develop.

          Bike course. Each course runs for half a day per week for ten weeks at
          one of our bike workshops, located in Maryhill and Bridgeton. Neil and
          Steven, our talented bike trainers, teach people how to rebuild bikes

            We hope to encourage confidence, pride and motivation amongst
            specific skills that can be useful in other aspects of life: time
            keeping, communication, and keeping track of instructions. All the
            while, getting the opportunity to engage with like-minded minds.

            Building bikes isn't for everyone, but we want to enable as many
            people as possible to afford the opportunity to cycle. Whether you
            are a bike enthusiast looking for a classic racing frame with modern

            take a look at our bike shop.

            All of our bikes are thoroughly cleaned, checked and tested, with

            for theatrical hire, including some authentic vintage bikes. If we
            don't have what you want in stock we may be able to make something
            that suits your needs.

            “I have now had three bikes put together from old (and some new)

            visit I get undivided attention and good advice—advice that you can
            tell isn't salesman talk. And you feel that the people who work
            there take pride in what they do, which shows in the bikes they make
            and how they make them. As a Dutch dad with two kids, our bikes are

          most of our staff are working part time so it may take a few days to
          get back to you.

        <p>
          Once we have received the form, the project coordinator will contact
          you. If possible, they will arrange an interest visit. This is a short
          meeting with yourself, your client and a member of the Common Wheel
          team. At the meeting we will provide more details about the project
          and give you and your client a chance to ask questions. Following the
          interest visit, if all parties agree that the project is suitable for
          your client, we will contact you to arrange a start date.
